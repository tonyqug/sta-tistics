## 🚀 Problem: Issues in Large Classrooms
Large lecture environments create several challenges for both students and professors:
- ❌ Limited student-professor communication
- ❌ Unaddressed student questions
- ❌ Professors unable to gauge class understanding
- ❌ Intrusive or disruptive questioning
- ❌ Busy interfaces distracting students
- ❌ Selective filtering of questions by professors

## 💡 Traditional Solutions
Existing approaches often fall short:
- 📢 Open Q&A sessions can be disruptive
- 📝 Digital platforms lack automation and intelligence
- ⚡ Students still struggle with real-time clarifications

## 🤖 Our Solution: Retrieval-Augmented GenAI
We introduce an AI-powered assistant to revolutionize classroom engagement!

### 📌 For Professors
✅ **Slide Presentation Suite** - Enhanced lecture delivery
✅ **Live AI-Powered Q&A** - Questions answered in real-time for review
✅ **Student Feedback Analytics** - Insights into understanding per slide
✅ **Comprehensive Analytics** - Track student comprehension trends

### 📌 For Students
✅ **AI-Assisted Q&A** - Automated responses referencing lecture materials
✅ **RAG-Enhanced Model** - Reducing hallucinations in AI-generated answers
✅ **One-Click Feedback** - Instant feedback for clarity

## ⚠️ Limitations
- 🛠 Currently using a **weaker** GenAI model due to resource constraints
- 🔄 While RAG improves accuracy, **hallucinations cannot be fully eliminated**
- 📊 AI highlights frequently asked questions, but human moderation is still needed

## 🎯 Future Prospects
- ✨ **Teacher Assistant Mode**: Allows TAs to flag and refine AI responses
- 🎥 **Demo & Q&A**: Upcoming showcase of the system in action!
